# KW_TweetCollection
Dataset consisting of 8698 tagged tweets from September 2017

The number of characters in the tweets was 140 characters even though the tweets could have a longer length. This problem should be to the twitter API that to get the full tweet it is necessary to activate a flag in the request.

Important:
The dataset is made up of "tweet id" .key due to twitter's usage policies not allowing tweets to be shared. However, the content of the * .key file is made up of words considered as "keywords" by annotators who volunteered to perform this task.
